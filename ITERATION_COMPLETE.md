## 🔍 ARCHITECTURAL IMPROVEMENTS

### From Hard-Coded to AST-Based Analysis:
```rust
// OLD: Brittle string matching
if rule_name.contains("field_name") { /* ... */ }

// NEW: Proper AST analysis
fn extract_condition_reads(condition: &ConditionGroup) -> HashSet<String> {
    match condition {
        ConditionGroup::Single(cond) => {
            let mut reads = HashSet::new();
            reads.insert(cond.field.clone());
            reads
        },
        ConditionGroup::And(conditions) | ConditionGroup::Or(conditions) => {
            conditions.iter()
                .flat_map(|c| extract_condition_reads(c))
                .collect()
        }
    }
