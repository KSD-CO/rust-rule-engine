# Benchmark Results: Traditional Engine vs RETE Algorithm

## Executive Summary

RETE algorithm implementation shows **consistent 2-2.8x performance improvement** over traditional rule engine across all test scenarios.

## Test Environment

- **Platform**: macOS (Darwin 24.6.0)
- **Rust Version**: Stable
- **Test Date**: 2025-11-01
- **Benchmark Tool**: Criterion.rs

## Performance Comparison

### 1. Rule Scaling Benchmark

Tests how engines perform as the number of rules increases:

| Number of Rules | Traditional Engine | RETE Engine | Speedup |
|----------------|-------------------|-------------|---------|
| 3 rules | 9.34 µs | 3.99 µs | **2.34x faster** ⚡ |
| 10 rules | 28.50 µs | 13.85 µs | **2.06x faster** ⚡ |
| 25 rules | 59.87 µs | 28.24 µs | **2.12x faster** ⚡ |

**Key Insight**: RETE maintains consistent ~2x speedup regardless of rule count, demonstrating excellent scalability.

### 2. Pattern Matching Benchmark

Tests performance with different pattern complexities:

| Pattern Type | Traditional | RETE | Speedup |
|-------------|------------|------|---------|
| **Simple Pattern**<br>(single condition: `age > 25`) | 2.79 µs | 1.24 µs | **2.25x faster** ⚡ |
| **Complex Pattern**<br>(3 conditions: `age > 25 AND spending > 1000 AND country == "US"`) | 5.02 µs | 1.79 µs | **2.81x faster** ⚡⚡ |

**Key Insight**: RETE performs even better with complex patterns, showing **2.81x speedup** for multi-condition rules.

### 3. Basic Execution Benchmark

Simple 3-rule comparison:

- **Traditional**: 8.69 µs
- **RETE**: 3.45 µs
- **Speedup**: **2.52x faster** ⚡

## Performance Characteristics

### Traditional Engine
- **Strengths**:
  - Simpler implementation
  - Lower memory overhead for small rule sets
  - Good for dynamic rule changes

- **Weaknesses**:
  - Re-evaluates all rules on every execution
  - Performance degrades with rule count
  - No fact change optimization

### RETE Engine
- **Strengths**:
  - Pre-built node network (one-time cost)
  - Efficient pattern matching
  - Scales well with rule count
  - Optimized for complex patterns

- **Weaknesses**:
  - Initial setup cost (network building)
  - Higher memory usage for large rule sets
  - Fixed agenda execution (max 100 iterations)

## Unit Test Performance

RETE engine unit tests show excellent microsecond-level performance:

| Test Case | Execution Time | Rules Fired |
|-----------|---------------|-------------|
| Single rule | 6.25 µs | 1 |
| 3 rules | 14.17 µs | 3 |
| 5 rules | 24.33 µs | 5 |
| 10 rules | 48.29 µs | 10 |
| 20 rules | 100.71 µs | 20 |

**Average**: ~5 µs per rule

## Recommendations

### Use RETE When:
✅ You have 10+ rules
✅ Rules have complex multi-condition patterns
✅ Performance is critical
✅ Facts change incrementally
✅ Rules are relatively static

### Use Traditional When:
✅ You have < 10 simple rules
✅ Rules change frequently
✅ Memory is constrained
✅ Simplicity is preferred
