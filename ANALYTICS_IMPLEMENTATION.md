## 🔧 Integration Points

### Engine Integration
```rust
// Enable analytics
let analytics_config = AnalyticsConfig::production();
let analytics = RuleAnalytics::new(analytics_config);
engine.enable_analytics(analytics);

// Analytics automatically collect during execution
let result = engine.execute(&facts)?;

// Access insights
if let Some(analytics) = engine.analytics() {
    let stats = analytics.overall_stats();
    let recommendations = analytics.generate_recommendations();
}
```

### API Surface
