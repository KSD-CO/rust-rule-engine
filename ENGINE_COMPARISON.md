# Engine Comparison: Native vs RETE-UL

## Overview

Rust Rule Engine currently has **2 separate engines**, each suitable for different use cases:

1. **Native Engine** (`RustRuleEngine`) - General-purpose rule engine
2. **RETE-UL Engine** (`IncrementalEngine`) - High-performance pattern matcher

## Use Case Recommendations

### ✅ Use Native Engine When:

1. **Plugin Integration Required**
   - Need built-in string/math/date utilities
   - Want action handlers (SendEmail, LogToDatabase, etc.)
   - Require workflow engine features

2. **Simple Business Rules**
   - < 50 rules
   - Straightforward conditions (no complex patterns)
   - Don't need incremental updates

3. **Analytics & Monitoring**
   - Need rule performance tracking
   - Want REST API integration
   - Require coverage analysis

4. **Getting Started / Prototyping**
   - Learning curve is easier
   - Simpler API
   - More batteries included

5. **Low Memory Environments**
   - Memory constraints
   - Minimal overhead needed

**Example Use Cases**:
- Small business rule engine
- Configuration-driven logic
- Simple validation rules
- Integration with existing plugins

```rust
// Native Engine - Simple and batteries included
let kb = KnowledgeBase::new("MyApp");
let mut engine = RustRuleEngine::new(kb);
engine.load_rules_from_file("rules.grl")?;
engine.execute(&facts)?;
```

### ✅ Use RETE-UL Engine When:

1. **High Performance Required**
   - > 100 rules
   - Real-time processing
   - Streaming data
   - Low latency requirements

2. **Complex Pattern Matching**
   - Variable binding across facts
   - Multi-object patterns (JOINs)
   - Cross-pattern constraints
   - Drools-style patterns

3. **Incremental Updates**
   - Facts change frequently
   - Need to track changes
   - Want selective re-evaluation

4. **Drools Migration**
   - Porting from Drools
   - Need 95% compatibility
   - Complex rule sets

5. **Working Memory Management**
   - Need FactHandles
   - Insert/Update/Retract operations
   - Fact metadata tracking

**Example Use Cases**:
- High-frequency trading systems
- Real-time fraud detection
- Complex expert systems
- Event stream processing
- IoT data processing

```rust
// RETE-UL Engine - High performance pattern matching
let mut engine = IncrementalEngine::new();
GrlReteLoader::load_from_file("rules.grl", &mut engine)?;

// Incremental updates - only affected rules re-evaluated
let handle = engine.insert("Order".to_string(), order);
engine.update(handle, updated_order)?; // 35µs!
```

## Migration Path

### From Native → RETE-UL

**What you gain**:
- ✅ 2-16x performance improvement
- ✅ Incremental updates
- ✅ Pattern matching capabilities
- ✅ Drools compatibility

**What you lose** (temporarily):
- ❌ Plugin system integration
- ❌ Action handlers
- ❌ Analytics
- ❌ REST API

**Migration Steps**:
1. Keep existing Native engine for features
2. Use RETE-UL for performance-critical rules
3. Load same GRL files with `GrlReteLoader`
4. Test performance improvements
5. Gradually migrate rules

**Code Example**:
```rust
// Before: Native Engine
let mut native = RustRuleEngine::new(kb);
native.load_rules_from_file("rules.grl")?;

// After: RETE-UL Engine
let mut rete = IncrementalEngine::new();
GrlReteLoader::load_from_file("rules.grl", &mut rete)?;

// Both support same GRL syntax!
```

### Hybrid Approach

Use **both engines** for different purposes:

```rust
// Native for plugin-rich rules
let mut native_engine = RustRuleEngine::new(kb);
native_engine.load_rules_from_file("business_logic.grl")?;

// RETE for performance-critical rules
let mut rete_engine = IncrementalEngine::new();
GrlReteLoader::load_from_file("streaming_rules.grl", &mut rete_engine)?;

// Execute both
native_engine.execute(&facts)?;
rete_engine.fire_all();
```

    .with_plugins(true)
    .with_rete(true);

// Automatically uses:
// - Native for plugin-heavy rules
// - RETE for performance-critical rules
engine.load_rules_from_file("rules.grl")?;

## Recommendations

### 🎯 Default Choice: **Depends on Your Needs**

**Start with Native Engine if**:
- You're new to rule engines
- Need plugins/action handlers
- Have < 50 rules
- Want simpler API

**Start with RETE-UL if**:
- Performance is critical
- Have > 100 rules
- Need pattern matching
- Migrating from Drools

### 🚀 Production Recommendation

For **production systems**, consider:

1. **Prototype with Native** (faster development)
2. **Benchmark with RETE-UL** (if performance issues)
3. **Use Hybrid** (best of both worlds)

### 📈 Scalability

| Rules | Native | RETE-UL | Recommendation |
|-------|--------|---------|----------------|
| < 20 | ✅ | ✅ | Native (simpler) |
| 20-50 | ✅ | ✅✅ | Native or RETE |
| 50-100 | ⚠️ | ✅✅ | RETE preferred |
| 100-500 | ❌ | ✅✅✅ | **RETE only** |
| > 500 | ❌ | ✅✅✅ | **RETE only** |

---

## Conclusion

**Both engines are production-ready** for their respective use cases:

- **Native Engine**: Best for **feature-rich** applications with moderate rule counts
- **RETE-UL Engine**: Best for **high-performance** applications with complex patterns

**No need to choose just one** - use both engines where appropriate!
