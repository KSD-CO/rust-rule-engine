## [0.2.1] - 2025-10-02

### Added
- **Rule Templates System**: Complete template-based rule generation with parameterization
  - `RuleTemplate` with parameter definitions and substitution
  - `TemplateManager` for template management and JSON serialization
  - `ParameterType` enum supporting String, Number, Boolean, Array types
  - Template instantiation with parameter validation
  - Bulk rule generation from templates
- New examples: `rule_templates_concept.rs`, `rule_templates_demo.rs`
- Enhanced GRL parsing test cases

### Fixed
- **Critical Parser Fix**: GRL parser now supports quoted rule names
  - Updated regex from `r"rule\s+\w+[^}]*\}"` to `r#"rule\s+(?:"[^"]+"|[a-zA-Z_]\w*)[^}]*\}"`
  - Both quoted (`"RuleName"`) and unquoted (`RuleName`) rule names now supported
  - All existing rule parsing continues to work without regression

### Improved
- Enhanced template system documentation

## [0.1.2] - 2025-10-01

### Fixed
- **Critical Fix**: Resolved infinite loop issue in rule execution
- Fixed custom functions to properly update facts in memory using `facts.set_nested()`
- Added guard conditions to example rules to prevent re-firing
- Improved engine configuration with `max_cycles` setting to prevent infinite loops

### Added
- Enhanced inline rules demo with proper fact updates
- Added `Customer.setLoyaltyBonusApplied()` and `Transaction.setRiskProcessed()` functions
- Better debugging output for rule execution cycles

### Changed
- Default `max_cycles` in examples set to 1 to prevent infinite loops
- Custom functions now properly modify facts state instead of just returning strings
